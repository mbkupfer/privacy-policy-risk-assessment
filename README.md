**Background**

Privacy policies, there are "they’re verbose and full of legal jargon — and opaquely establish companies’ justifications for collecting and selling your data. The data market has become the engine of the internet, and these privacy policies we agree to but don't fully understand help fuel it" [1]

We tend to always shrug off those updated privacy policy emails since no one has the time or legal knowledge to pour through that text, but in this digital age, protecting our digital identity is becoming more and more vital.

**Goal**

Fine-tune an LLM to create an easy to digest summary of risks in a privacy policy or terms of service.

- Risks should be based on an exhaustive list to facilitate comparisons
- Risks will be presented as a discrete score
- Should have separate summaries from the perspective businesses and consumers
